![Extension in Action](assets/animation.gif)\
A VS Code extension that automatically converts string interpolation to template literals. Never manually convert quotes to backticks again!

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Conversion**: Instantly converts string interpolation to template literals
- **Smart Detection**: Works with both single and double quotes
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with no setup required
- **Lightning Fast**: Real-time conversion as you type

### How It Works

When you type `${}` inside single or double quotes in JavaScript/TypeScript files, the extension automatically converts the quotes to backticks, creating a template literal.

**Examples:**

```javascript
"Hello ${name}" => `Hello ${name}`;
"Hello ${name}" => `Hello ${name}`;
```
